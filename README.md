# Favorites Hub

A project made for fun and as an excuse to learn Vue.js, and since i needed a database to store my data why not learn some backend stuff too?

I like to keep track of my favorite tv shows on a text file, so i decided to build this web application instead of continuing to update the boring text files.

## The main technologies used are:

#### Frontend

- Vue.js with Vue Loader, Vue Router and Vuex
- SCSS

#### Backend

- Node.js with Express and mongoose
- MongoDB
